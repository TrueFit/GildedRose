All times are in the same time zone, whatever that might be (Azeroth Standard Time?).  There is 
only one Gilded Rose location so we don't need to worry about the complications of data being 
entered from different time zones.

The base rate of item quality delta is 1 quality unit per day (can be configured per item type).

If an item has an initial quality value outside the min and max range for quality of that item, the 
initial quality will be clamped before calculating the current value.  This implies that for an 
item using the Linear strategy, the current quality will degrade after the first day rather than 
having to first burn through a quality buffer above the maximum threshold value before seeing any 
effective change in the current value.  E.g., an item with a max quality of 50 and an initial 
quality of 100 will have a current quality of 50 on the inventory date and a quality of 49 the next 
day.

Sell By Date is inclusive.  A Sell By Date of January 1st means the item must be sold by the end of 
the day, January 1st.

User managment (login/audit/permissions) is outside the scope of this exercise but would be a 
fundamental part of a production system.  Ideally this would be handled by some type of shared 
identity management system and this system would only track pointers to records in the identity
management system.
