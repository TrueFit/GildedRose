I had a blast working on this skills test!  I think this is a great way of measuring my fit for this position.  Unfortunately, I do not have all the time in the world, so I am submitting this project as-is with some notes on how to get it working and what I would change if I had more time.

1. You'll need to run npm install in the reactapp dir in order to get the necessary node modules.
2. Included is a backup file for a microsoft sql database.  Simply restore it, and its good to go. 
	"\GildedRose\Data\GildedRoseDBContext.cs" contains the connection string to the database. Adjust if needed.
3. Open the SLN file in Visual Studio, select the "GildedRoseAPI" profile, and run the project.  It should run the backend build, as well as launch the front end react app.  
	"\GildedRose\Properties\launchSettings.json" contains the launch settings.  Adjust if needed.
4. Play around!  I implemented some bonus endpoints to reset the data and to take out the trash.


Some notes:

If I were not in a rush, here's a few things I would do differently.  Feel free to ask additional details about why/how in the technical interview!

-Not hardcode db connection string, move to appsettings file.
-Not hardcode api url in front end components.
-Extract api to its own script and make calls through that (DRY for the fetch code)
-Redo Item Category as an enum, write conversion code from negotiating enum/int/string when converting from back end to front end.
-Create form for adding new items.
-Make tables sortable by clicking on header col, ascending and descending.
-Publish to free azure account.
-Authentication/Account Creation/Roles Based Access Control for certain functions (such as trashing, adding, etc).
-Unit testing, particularly for the progression function.
-I might also do that big 'process' function differently, by creating a map of individual 'process' functions keyed by category.  


All of these are things I could do, but given my time constaints, I feel it would be best for us to just talk about these items, instead.  I'm happy to answer any questions!
